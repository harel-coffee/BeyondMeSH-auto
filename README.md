A weakly supervised approach for fine-grained semantic indexing of biomedical literature

This repository includes the source code and some data for the develoment of models fro fine-grained semantic indexing of biomedical articles.
In particular in includes,
1. A folder (Data) with dataset files about the Alzheimer's Disease, that are required to develop the weakly-supervised fine-grained semantic indexing models. For a detailed description of these files see the corresponding REAMDE file.
2. The scripts for processing the initial datatset files to develop weakly supervised models for fine-grained semantic indexing.
